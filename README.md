# PMaxcut

## Summary

This repository contains the implementation of the ideas and experiments from [Bathie20].  
We introduce a more accurate way to give an upper bound on the memory used in any parallel scheduling
of a DAG on a machine with `p` processors.  
We also provide a basic library to manipulate Graphs.  

## Usage :

- Use the `Makefile` to compile
- Run `main` and store the result in a file if you want to generate the tables as in [Bathie20]
- Run the `plot.py` on the file containing the results to produce the formatting.
